## Motivation

I love video games! I always wanted to make my own video game. I read a lot about different game engines and chose [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/phaser3). Here I'll make small demos for training. Just for fun! Maybe someday I'll make a real video game 🎮

## Prerequisites

- npm >=6.0.0
- node >=14.0.0

```

## Usage

Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

## Build
